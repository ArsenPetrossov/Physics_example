Task 2 -the task is to make visual highlighting of tiles when the cursor is hovered over. That is, when the player moves the cursor over a certain tile, its color should change, and when the player moves the cursor away from the tile - its color returns to the original. 
Important condition - selection should work only for tiles with grass or bridge. Tiles with water should not be highlighted.

Resolved - I used onMouseEnter and onMouseExit events
